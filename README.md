# Linear-Regression-on-Boston-Housing-Dataset
In this post, we are going to learn about implementing linear regression on Boston Housing dataset using scikit-learn.

Boston Housing Dataset
The Boston Housing Dataset consists of price of houses in various places in Boston. Alongside with price, the dataset also provide information such as Crime (CRIM), areas of non-retail business in the town (INDUS), the age of people who own the house (AGE), and there are many other attributes that available .

The dataset itself is available . However, because we are going to use scikit-learn, we can import it right away from the scikit-learn itself. In this story, we will use several python libraries as required here.
